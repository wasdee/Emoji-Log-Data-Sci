Also, looking at the Gruntfile, and the `lightSpeedIn.css` and `lightSpeedOut.css` filenames, it looks like this file needs to be corrected anyway.  Hopefully this will help people avoid the bug I created, and also improve the build script.\n",

This keeps the miniReporter output always at the bottom of the log output.\n",

      "1) Function declarations are wrapped using function declarations.\n",

      "   expressions. They already had the same behavior, but the one\n",
      "   used for named functions was a bit longer.\n",

      "   function expressions.\n",

      "  constructor() { this.x = 1; }\n",
      "\n",

      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the specification the `State.prototype.clone` method is\n",
      "non-enumerable. However when transpiling this with loose mode, we get\n",
      "the following output:\n",
      "\n",
      "```js\n",
      "var State = (function() {\n",
      "  function State() { this.x = 1; }\n",
      "\n",
      "  State.prototype.clone = function clone() {\n",
      "    var state = new State();\n",
      "    for (var key in this) {\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "So all of a sudden the `State.prototype.clone` method is enumerable.\n",
      "This means that the `for..in` loop inside of that method enumerates\n",
      "`x` and `clone` for `key`, whereas originally it was supposed to only\n",
      "enumerate `x`. This in turn means that the shape of the result of a\n",
      "call to `clone` will be different than the shape of a state that is\n",
      "created via the `State` constructor. You can check this in `d8` using\n",
      "the `--allow-natives-syntax` flag and this simple test driver:\n",
      "\n",
      "```js\n",
      "const s = new State;\n",
      "%DebugPrint(s);\n",
      "%DebugPrint(s.clone());\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Using either the class version or the transpiled version we see:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "$ out/Release/d8 --allow-natives-syntax state-original.js\n",
      "0x2a9d7970d329 <State map = 0x2a9d40b0c751>\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "So as you can see, the transpiled version (using *loose mode*) produces\n",
      "a different shape for the result of `clone`, whereas the original\n",
      "version is fine. This pollutes all sites which use either a state\n",

      "\n",
      "To mitigate this effect, it's best to guard the `for..in` loops with\n",

The relevant code in Node.JS can be found here (tagged at the v5.4.1 release): https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/ff992037246010fdad6f72323fe556da69640531/lib/module.js#L236-L242.\n",
